Nowadays Driver fatigue is a major factor in a large number of vehicle accidents. Recent statistics estimate that annually 1,200 deaths and 76,000 injuries can be attributed to fatigue related crashes. The development of technologies for detecting and avoiding drowsiness at the wheel is a major challenge in the field of accident -avoidance systems. Because of the hazard that drowsiness presents on the road, methods need to be developed for counteracting its affects. Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving. Not only limited to the drivers, this system can also be used by 
watchmen as they fall asleep and various mishap takes place. Students while studying, often fall asleep this system will help them stay alert and focus on their studies. The system will detect the early symptoms of drowsiness before the user has fully lost all attentiveness and warn the user that they are no longer capable of 
operating the vehicle safely or are lacking in their task.Drowsiness detection systems are designed to detect signs of fatigue or sleepiness in drivers while they are operating a vehicle. These systems typically use cameras, sensors, or wearable devices to monitor the driver's eye movements, head position, and facial expressions. Some drowsiness detection systems also use data from other sources, such as the vehicle's onboard systems, to detect changes in driving patterns that may indicate drowsiness. When drowsiness is detected, the system may provide an alert to the person to encourage them to take a break and rest.
